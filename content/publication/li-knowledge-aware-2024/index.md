abstract: 'With the rapid development of remote sensing image archives, asking questions
  about images has become an effective way of gathering specific information or performing
  image retrieval. However, automatically generated image-based questions tend to
  be simplistic and template-based, which hinders the real deployment of question
  answering or visual dialogue systems. To enrich and diversify the questions, we
  propose a knowledge-aware remote sensing visual question generation model, KRSVQG,
  that incorporates external knowledge related to the image content to improve the
  quality and contextual understanding of the generated questions. The model takes
  an image and a related knowledge triplet from external knowledge sources as inputs
  and leverages image captioning as an intermediary representation to enhance the
  image grounding of the generated questions. To assess the performance of KRSVQG,
  we utilized two datasets that we manually annotated: NWPU-300 and TextRS-300. Results
  on these two datasets demonstrate that KRSVQG outperforms existing methods and leads
  to knowledge-enriched questions, grounded in both image and domain knowledge.'
