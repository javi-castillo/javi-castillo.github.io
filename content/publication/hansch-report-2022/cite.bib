 abstract = {The Image Analysis and Data Fusion (IADF) Technical Committee (TC) of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) has been organizing the annual Data Fusion Contest (DFC) since 2006. The contest promotes the development of methods for extracting geospatial information from large-scale, multisensor, multimodal, and multitemporal data. It aims to propose new problem settings that are challenging to address with existing techniques and to establish new benchmarks for scientific challenges in remote sensing image analysis [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19].},
