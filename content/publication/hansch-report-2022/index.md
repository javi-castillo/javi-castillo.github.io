abstract: The Image Analysis and Data Fusion (IADF) Technical Committee (TC) of the
  IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) has been organizing the annual
  Data Fusion Contest (DFC) since 2006. The contest promotes the development of methods
  for extracting geospatial information from large-scale, multisensor, multimodal,
  and multitemporal data. It aims to propose new problem settings that are challenging
  to address with existing techniques and to establish new benchmarks for scientific
  challenges in remote sensing image analysis [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8],
  [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19].
