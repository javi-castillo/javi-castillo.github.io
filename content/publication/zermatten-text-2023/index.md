abstract: This paper introduces TACOSS a text-image alignment approach that allows
  explainable land cover semantic segmentation by directly integrating semantic concepts
  encoded from texts. TACOSS combines convolutional neural networks for visual feature
  extraction with semantic embeddings provided by a language model. By leveraging
  contrastive learning approaches, we learn an alignment between the visual and the
  (fixed) textual representations. In addition to producing standard semantic segmentation
  outputs, our model enables interactive queries with RS images using natural language
  prompts. The experimental results obtained on 50cm resolution aerial data from Switzerland
  show that TACOSS performs similarly to a standard semantic segmentation model while
  allowing the flexible usage of in- and out-of-vocabulary terms for the interactions
  with the image.
