abstract: 'This work explores different aspects of semantic segmentation of remote
  sensing data using deep neural networks.The availability of large databases of fully
  annotated data is the basis for good performances of current neural networks. Although
  images on remote sensing are abundant, annotations are very rare or difﬁcult to
  produce. In this context, two questions arise: ﬁrst, how robust are existing supervised
  learning strategies with respect to data? Second, is it possible to improve performance
  of current methods by using non annotated data? Our main contributions are: (i)
  a strong robustness analysis of existing supervised learning strategies with respect
  to remote sensing data, (ii) the introduction of a semi-supervised architecture,
  capable of learning from annotated and non annotated images simultaneously.'
