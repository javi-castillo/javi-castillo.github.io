abstract: 'The development of semi-supervised learning techniques is essential to
  enhance the generalization capacities of machine learning algorithms. Indeed, raw
  image data are abundant while labels are scarce, therefore it is crucial to leverage
  unlabeled inputs to build better models. The availability of large databases have
  been key for the development of learning algorithms with high level performance.
  Despite the major role of machine learning in Earth Observation to derive products
  such as land cover maps, datasets in the field are still limited, either because
  of modest surface coverage, lack of variety of scenes or restricted classes to identify.
  We introduce a novel large-scale dataset for semi-supervised semantic segmentation
  in Earth Observation, the MiniFrance suite. MiniFrance has several unprecedented
  properties: it is large-scale, containing over 2000 very high resolution aerial
  images, accounting for more than 200 billions samples (pixels); it is varied, covering
  16 conurbations in France, with various climates, different landscapes, and urban
  as well as countryside scenes; and it is challenging, considering land use classes
  with high-level semantics. Nevertheless, the most distinctive quality of MiniFrance
  is being the only dataset in the field especially designed for semi-supervised learning:
  it contains labeled and unlabeled images in its training partition, which reproduces
  a life-like scenario. Along with this dataset, we present tools for data representativeness
  analysis in terms of appearance similarity and a thorough study of MiniFrance data,
  demonstrating that it is suitable for learning and generalizes well in a semi-supervised
  setting. Finally, we present semi-supervised deep architectures based on multi-task
  learning and the first experiments on MiniFrance. These results will serve as baselines
  for future work on semi-supervised learning over the MiniFrance dataset. The Minifrance
  suite and related semi-supervised networks will be publicly available to promote
  semi-supervised works in Earth Observation.'
