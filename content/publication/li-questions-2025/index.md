abstract: 'With the rapid development of remote sensing image archives, asking questions
  about images has become an effective way of gathering specific information or performing
  semantic image retrieval. However, current automatically generated questions tend
  to be simplistic and template-based, which hinders the deployment of question answering
  or visual dialogue systems for real-world applications. To enrich and diversify
  the questions with both image content and commonsense knowledge, we propose a Knowledge-aware
  Remote Sensing Visual Question Generation model (KRSVQG). The proposed model incorporates
  related knowledge triplets from external knowledge sources to broaden the question
  content, while employing image captioning as an intermediary representation to ground
  questions to the corresponding images. Moreover, KRSVQG utilizes a vision-language
  pretraining and fine-tuning strategy, enabling the model’s adaptation to low data
  regimes. To evaluate the proposed KRSVQG model, we construct two knowledge-aware
  remote sensing visual question generation datasets: The NWPU-300 dataset and the
  TextRS-300 dataset. Evaluations, including metrics and human assessment, demonstrate
  that KRSVQG outperforms existing methods and leads to rich questions, grounded in
  both image and domain knowledge. As a key practice in vision-language research,
  knowledge-aware visual question generation advances the understanding of image content
  beyond pixels, facilitating the development of knowledge-enriched vision-language
  systems with vision-grounded human commonsense.'
