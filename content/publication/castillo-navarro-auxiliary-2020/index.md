abstract: The development of semi-supervised learning methods is essential to Earth
  Observation applications. Indeed, labeled remote sensing data are scarce and likely
  insufficient to train fully supervised models with good generalization capacities.
  Conversely, raw data are abundant and therefore it is crucial to leverage unlabeled
  inputs to build better deep learning models. This work addresses the problem of
  semisupervised semantic segmentation from a multi-task learning perspective. In
  this context, we explore several auxiliary tasks (reconstruction, unsupervised segmentation
  or self-supervision), and corresponding unsupervised losses, to perform along with
  semantic segmentation. Our experiments show the potential of semi-supervised learning
  approaches in a lifelike scenario, outperforming a classical supervised setting.
