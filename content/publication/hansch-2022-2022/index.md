abstract: Data availability plays a central role in any machine learning setup, especially
  since the rise of deep learning. Although input data are often available in abundance,
  reference data used to train and evaluate corresponding approaches are usually scarce
  due to the high cost of obtaining them. Although this is not limited to remote sensing,
  it is of particular importance in Earth-observation applications. Semisupervised
  learning is one approach to mitigate this challenge and leverage the large amount
  of available input data while relying only on a small, annotated training set.
