abstract: 'Natural ecosystem maps are a fundamental tool for describing natural habitats. They are used
when analysing ecological networks, for studying ecological connectivity, for conservation planning
or for the management of ecosystem services. While remote sensing information is commonly
employed for mapping land cover, accurate ecosystem maps require going beyond the
classification of the physical surface of the land and attempting to distinguish different
communities of living beings. New research directions for ecosystem classification leverage
species observations created by citizen scientists on social media or crowd-sourcing platforms,
profiting from their extensive spatial and temporal coverage and their low acquisition cost.
In this work, we make complimentary use of crowd-sourced data with remote sensing imagery to
produce ecosystem maps in alpine areas. Our study area covers the state of Valais, a territory of
about 5, 000km2 in southwestern Switzerland. We retrieve nearly 3 million species observations
from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database that includes governmental,
crowd-sourced and scientific observations. We combine the species data with high-resolution
aerial remote sensing imagery provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Topography swisstopo. As
reference ecosystem maps, we follow the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) at a 100m
scale. To solve the task of classifying ecosystems, we propose a multi-modal data fusion approach
based on a multi-modal transformer architecture. Such a model can handle redundant and
complementary information coming from different data sources and provide an explicit and
interpretable decision through the visualisation of its attention scores. Through our preliminary
experiments, we observed that the unequal distribution of samples between the classes and also
the sampling biases negatively impacted the performance of our approach. We are working
towards a more informative inclusion of species observation and a more balanced learning of
each ecosystem type.'
