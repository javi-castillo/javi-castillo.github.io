abstract: Introduced to enable a wider use of Earth Observation images using natural
  language, Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) remains a challenging
  task, in particular for questions related to counting. To address this specific
  challenge, we propose a modular Multi-task prompt-RSVQA model based on object detection
  and question answering modules. By creating a semantic bottleneck describing the
  image and providing a visual answer, our model allows users to assess the visual
  grounding of the answer and better interpret the prediction. A set of ablation studies
  are designed to consider the contributions of different modules and evaluation metrics
  are discussed for a finer-grained assessment. Experiments demonstrate competitive
  results against literature baselines and a zero-shot VQA model. In particular, our
  proposed model predicts answers for numerical Counting questions that are consistently
  closer in distance to the ground truth.
