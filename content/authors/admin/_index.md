      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor (_maÃ®tre de confÃ©rences_ in French) in the [Vertigo team](https://cedric.cnam.fr/lab/teams/vertigo-en/) at Cnam, Paris. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL, Switzerland, in the ECEO lab, advised by [Devis Tuia](https://people.epfl.ch/devis.tuia). I obtained my PhD in computer science under the supervision of [SÃ©bastien LefÃ¨vre](http://people.irisa.fr/Sebastien.Lefevre/), [Bertrand Le Saux](https://blesaux.github.io/), and [Alexandre Boulch](https://www.boulch.eu/), where I developed semi-supervised learning methods for semantic segmentation and classification.

My research :nerd_face: focuses on computer vision, representation learning, and multimodal learning, including (but not limited to) vision-and-language models.

<!-- Since September 2024, I am an Assistant Professor (maÃ®tre de confÃ©rences) in computer science and artificial intelligence at the Conservatoire national des arts et mÃ©tiers (Cnam) in Paris, France, where I joined the [Vertigo team](https://cedric.cnam.fr/lab/teams/vertigo-en/).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [ECEO](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/eceo/) lab of the Ecole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne, Switzerland. I worked with [Devis Tuia](https://sites.google.com/site/devistuia/) --in collaboration with the EPFL NLP lab-- to build [knowledge-guided explanations for satellite images](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/eceo/eceo/projects/).

I received my PhD on computer science and artificial intelligence from the [UniversitÃ© de Bretagne Sud](https://www.univ-ubs.fr/fr/index.html), France, in collaboration with [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/fr) and [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/), under the supervision of [Bertrand Le Saux](https://blesaux.github.io/), [Alexandre Boulch](https://www.boulch.eu/) and [SÃ©bastien LefÃ¨vre](http://people.irisa.fr/Sebastien.Lefevre/). I studied and developed semi-supervised models for semi-supervised semantic segmentation for Earth observation imagery.

My main research interests :nerd_face: are applied mathematics, statistics, machine learning, computer vision, and --more recently-- natural language processing. I'm currently working on the development of multimodal machine learning models and their applications to remote sensing imagery and Earth observation :earth_americas: . -->
